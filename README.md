## Why iOS Backup Explorer?

You made an encrypted iPhone backup with iTunes, Finder, or the Apple Devices app. Now you need to get your photos, messages, or health data out of it. You search online and find tools that:

- Cost $30–$80 for a license
- Upload your data to unknown servers
- Are closed source — you have no idea what they do with your passwords
- Haven't been updated since 2019

**iOS Backup Explorer is different.**

| | iOS Backup Explorer | Paid alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | Free forever | $30–$80 |
| **Open source** | Yes — read every line | No |
| **Network access** | None. Zero. Offline only. | Often phones home |
| **Your password** | Never stored, never sent | Who knows? |
| **Platform** | Windows, macOS, Linux | Usually one platform |

---

## Features

- **Decrypt encrypted backups** — Supports iOS 13+ encrypted local backups
- **Unencrypted backups too** — Detected automatically; no password needed
- **Read your messages like on the phone** — A Messages tab with your conversations as chat bubbles, tapbacks, attachments, contact names, search, and export to text, a web page, CSV or JSON. The original database and attachments can always be extracted untouched
- **A real file manager** — Folders on the left, files on the right, with back / forward / up, a location bar you can type a path into, and file-type icons
- **Sort by anything** — Click Name, Kind, Size, Date Modified or Date Created (clicking again reverses it); names sort naturally (`IMG_2` before `IMG_10`), folders can stay on top, and folder sizes are the total of what is inside
- **Browse by category** — Camera Roll, Messages, Health, Apps, and more
- **Search across all files** — Instant, searches the folder you are in and everything below it
- **Right-click** a file or folder to extract it, copy its name or path, or see its properties
- **Extract individual files or bulk export** — Save to any folder
- **Extract the entire backup** — One click, straight from the backup index, with no limit on how many files
- **Mount a backup as a read-only drive or folder** (optional) — Browse it in your file manager; on Windows as `\\ios-backup\...` with no drive letter
- **Auto-detects backups** — Finds your backup folder automatically
- **Cross-platform** — Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Small and auditable** — A few plain Python files you can read in an afternoon

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or newer** — [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **tkinter** — Included with Python on Windows and macOS. On Linux: `sudo apt install python3-tk`

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/slammingprogramming/iOS-backup-explorer.git
cd iOS-backup-explorer

# 2. Install dependencies (just one!)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run iOS Backup Explorer
python ios_backup_explorer.py
```

That's it. No build step, no Docker, no config files.

---

## Usage

### 1. Find your backup

iOS Backup Explorer auto-detects your backup location. If it doesn't, here's where iTunes/Finder stores them:

| Platform | Default backup location |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\` (iTunes installer) or `%USERPROFILE%\Apple\MobileSync\Backup\` (Microsoft Store iTunes / Apple Devices app) |
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/` |
| **Linux** | Backups must be copied from a Windows/Mac machine |

### 2. Enter your password (encrypted backups only)

iOS Backup Explorer detects whether the backup is encrypted. If it is not, the password box is disabled and you can just click **Open Backup**.

For an encrypted backup, this is the **encryption password you set in iTunes, Finder, or the Apple Devices app**, NOT your Apple ID password.

**Forgot your password?**
- **macOS:** Open Keychain Access, search for `iOS Backup` — the password is stored there
- **Windows:** Check if you saved it in your password manager

### 3. Browse and extract

- Click a category, domain or folder on the left, or double-click a folder in the list, to open it. Use the arrow buttons (or `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right`, `Backspace`) to go back, forward and up
- Click a column heading to sort. **Include subfolders** lists every file below the current folder in one flat list; **Folders first** keeps folders above files
- Use the search bar to find files in the current folder and below (several words must all match). `Ctrl+F` jumps to it
- Select files or folders and click **Extract Selected** (a folder extracts everything in it), or export what you see with **Extract All in View**. Very long lists are split into pages

### 4. Read your messages

If the backup contains Messages, a **Messages** tab appears next to **Files**.

- Conversations are listed newest first, with names taken from the backup's address book. An iMessage chat and an SMS chat with the same number are shown as one conversation, like on the phone
- Your messages are on the right in blue (green for SMS), theirs on the left in grey, with tapbacks, group events and day headings. Click an attachment to save it. Long conversations load a page at a time
- **Search messages** looks inside every conversation, including messages iOS 16 and later keep only in their archived form, and jumps to the match
- **Export this conversation / Export all** writes text files, a web page (with the attachments beside it, opens in any browser, no internet needed), a CSV spreadsheet, or JSON
- **Extract original files** copies the Messages database (with its recent-changes files) and the attachments exactly as the backup holds them, so you always have the raw data too

---

## Mounting a backup (optional)

Instead of extracting, you can **mount** the open backup as a read-only drive or folder and browse it with your normal file manager and programs. Click **Mount Backup**; click it again (now **Unmount Backup**) when you are done.

| Platform | What you get | What you need |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | A network-style path, `\\ios-backup\<backup name>`, with **no drive letter**. Type it into File Explorer's address bar | [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev) |
| **macOS** | An empty folder you choose | [macFUSE](https://macfuse.github.io) or [FUSE-T](https://www.fuse-t.org) |
| **Linux** | An empty folder you choose | FUSE (e.g. `sudo apt install fuse3`) |

On every platform you also need the small Python package (Python 3.9 or newer):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-mount.txt
```

Files from an encrypted backup are decrypted into a private temporary folder the first time you open them, and that folder is deleted when you unmount. Files from an unencrypted backup are read straight from the backup folder, with nothing copied. While a backup is mounted, programs running as you can read its decrypted contents; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Mounting adds no network access: the Windows path is served by WinFsp on your own computer.

Mounting was tested on Windows 10 with WinFsp. The macOS and Linux code paths follow the same design but have not been run on those systems yet, so please report problems.

## Security & Privacy

> **iPhone backups contain your most sensitive data — photos, messages, health records, passwords, financial apps, and more. You should be extremely careful about which tools you trust with this data.**

### Our security promises:

1. **100% Offline** — iOS Backup Explorer makes zero network connections. Disconnect your internet and it works identically. [Verify it yourself.](SECURITY.md)

2. **Your password is never stored** — It's held in memory only while the app runs. When you close iOS Backup Explorer, it's gone.

3. **No telemetry, no analytics, no tracking** — We don't know you exist. We don't want to.

4. **Fully auditable** — The app is a few plain Python files (about 5,000 lines in all, with no build step): the app itself, the file browser, the file index, the app views such as Messages, and an optional module that is only used if you mount a backup. Read them. We encourage it.

5. **Open source dependencies** — Our only required dependency ([iphone_backup_decrypt](https://github.com/jsharkey13/iphone_backup_decrypt)) is also open source and MIT licensed.

For our full security policy, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this safe to use?</strong></summary>

Yes. iOS Backup Explorer is 100% offline, open source, and makes no network connections. Your password never leaves your machine. You can verify all of this by reading the source code — it's a single file.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can iOS Backup Explorer crack/bypass my backup password?</strong></summary>

No. iOS Backup Explorer requires your correct encryption password to decrypt the backup. It cannot guess, crack, or bypass passwords. This is a feature, not a limitation — it means no one else can access your data without the password either.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are my messages complete?</strong></summary>

The newest messages on a phone are often not yet in the main database file but in a small companion "-wal" file. iOS Backup Explorer copies both together, so nothing recent is lost. Messages that you deleted on the phone before the backup was made are not in the backup. Message text that iOS stores only in its archived form is decoded; if some text looks wrong or is missing, please report it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this work with iCloud backups?</strong></summary>

No. iOS Backup Explorer only works with **local backups** (encrypted or not) created by iTunes, Finder, or the Apple Devices app. iCloud backups are stored on Apple's servers and cannot be accessed by this tool.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work with unencrypted backups?</strong></summary>

Yes. Unencrypted backups are detected automatically and opened without a password, read-only: the backup folder is never modified and no temporary copy of its index is made. They must use the `Manifest.db` layout (iTunes/Finder backups of iOS 10 and later); very old `Manifest.mbdb` backups are not supported.

Note that Apple leaves some data out of unencrypted backups (for example Health data and saved passwords), so you may find less in them than in an encrypted backup of the same device.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What iOS versions are supported?</strong></summary>

iOS Backup Explorer supports encrypted backups from **iOS 13 and newer** (including iOS 17, 18). This covers iPhone 6s and later.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I forgot my backup password. Can iOS Backup Explorer help?</strong></summary>

iOS Backup Explorer cannot recover forgotten passwords. However:
- **macOS users:** Check Keychain Access (search for "iOS Backup")
- **All users:** Try common passwords you may have used, or check your password manager
- As a last resort, you can [reset your backup password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102566) by resetting all settings on your iPhone (this won't delete your data, but you'll need to create a new backup)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Some files show warnings during extraction. Is that normal?</strong></summary>

Yes. Some files (especially app databases) may show size mismatch warnings. This is normal and usually means the file was being written to when the backup was created. The extracted data is still usable in most cases.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this on Linux?</strong></summary>

Yes! Install `python3-tk` (`sudo apt install python3-tk` on Ubuntu/Debian) and follow the normal installation steps. You'll need to copy your backup folder from a Windows or Mac machine first.
</details>

## Verify It Yourself

Don't trust us? Good. Here's how to confirm iOS Backup Explorer makes zero network connections:

```bash
# Option 1: Disconnect from the internet and run the app — it works identically.

# Option 2: Monitor network activity (macOS)
sudo lsof -i -P | grep python

# Option 3: Monitor network activity (Windows PowerShell)
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $_.OwningProcess -eq (Get-Process python).Id }

# Option 4: Read the source — it's a few plain Python files, about 5,000 lines in all.
```
