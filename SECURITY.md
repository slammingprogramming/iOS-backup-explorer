## Our Commitment

iOS Backup Explorer is designed from the ground up with your privacy and security as the top priority. We understand that iPhone backups contain some of the most sensitive data on your devices — photos, messages, health data, passwords, and more.

## How iOS Backup Explorer Protects You

### 100% Offline
- iOS Backup Explorer makes **zero network connections**. None. Ever.
- No HTTP requests, no DNS lookups, no telemetry, no analytics.
- You can verify this yourself: disconnect from the internet and the app works identically.
- You can also verify by reading every line of the source code — it's intentionally small and auditable.

### No Data Storage
- Your backup password is **never saved** to disk, logs, or any file.
- The password is discarded from the UI immediately after successful decryption and is not retained when you close the app.
- iOS Backup Explorer creates no config files, logs, or caches.
- While a backup is open, the decryption library keeps a **decrypted copy of `Manifest.db`** (the backup's file index: names, paths and wrapped per-file keys, not your file contents) in a temporary folder. It is deleted when you close the app or open a different backup. If the app is killed or crashes it may be left behind in your system temp folder, so delete stray `Manifest.db` copies there if that happens, and use full-disk encryption.
- Files you extract are written, **decrypted**, to the folder you choose. Protect or delete them yourself.

### No Tracking
- No usage analytics. No crash reporting. No fingerprinting.
- We don't know who you are, what you're extracting, or that you even use this tool.

### Open Source & Auditable
- The entire codebase is a single Python file — small enough to read in one sitting.
- We encourage security researchers to audit the code.
- All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and are open source themselves.

## Your Backup Password

The password you enter into iOS Backup Explorer is the **encryption password you set in iTunes or Finder** when you enabled encrypted backups. This is NOT your Apple ID password.

- If you don't remember your backup password, check your system keychain:
  - **macOS:** Keychain Access app, search for "iOS Backup"
  - **Windows:** The password is not stored in Windows Credential Manager by default
- iOS Backup Explorer cannot recover or bypass your password. This is by design — it means no one else can either.

## Supported Backup Sources

iOS Backup Explorer only reads **local iPhone/iPad backups** created by:
- iTunes (Windows)
- Finder (macOS 10.15+)
- Apple Devices app (Windows 11)

It does **not** access iCloud backups, which are stored on Apple's servers.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in iOS Backup Explorer, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities.
2. Use [GitHub's private security advisory feature](https://github.com/slammingprogramming/iOS-backup-explorer/security/advisories/new) to report the issue.
3. Include steps to reproduce, the potential impact, and any suggested fixes.

We will respond within 48 hours and work with you to address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Dependencies

iOS Backup Explorer depends on:
- **Python 3.8+** — [python.org](https://python.org)
- **tkinter** — Included with Python (standard library GUI toolkit)
- **iphone_backup_decrypt** — [GitHub](https://github.com/jsharkey13/iphone_backup_decrypt) — MIT licensed, open source library for decrypting iOS backups

We monitor our dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
